# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

The Work Day Scheduler application allows a user to time block their workday by entering text into each work day hour's time block.  The user will then be able to save the text they entered via clicking on the save icon.  That data will then be saved to the local storage and pulled the next time they visit the site so that the data appears where they saved it.
